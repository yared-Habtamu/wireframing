## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a fundamental step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating simple, low-detail representations of a digital product’s layout — such as a website or mobile app — focusing on structure, functionality, and user flow rather than visual design elements like colors or typography.

Think of a wireframe as the blueprint of a building — it outlines what goes where, how it works, and how users will interact with it.

## Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing plays a critical role in the design and development process for several key reasons:

* **Clarifies Structure Early**
  It helps designers and stakeholders agree on the layout and information hierarchy before investing time in visual design or development.

* **Improves Collaboration**
  Wireframes serve as a communication tool between designers, developers, product managers, and clients, ensuring everyone is aligned.

* **Identifies Usability Issues**
  By focusing on user interface structure, wireframes help reveal potential usability challenges early on.

* **Saves Time and Resources**
  Changes are easier and cheaper to make at the wireframing stage than later in high-fidelity mockups or code.

Wireframing provides a clear, visual foundation that guides the entire product design cycle — from idea to final execution.
